    <h1>I like to go swimming in the summer</h1>
    <p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find
        me dipping into my backyard pool. It;s not an impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.</p>
    <p>There are three reasons I like to swim:
    <ul>
        <li>I get lots of exervise</li>
        <li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
        <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
