    <h1>Things That Make Me Sneeze</h1>
    <p>I wanted to put together a quick list of stuff that makes me sneeze.</p>
    <p>It's because I keep forgetting to avoid this stuff, and maybe if I write it down then I'll remember it.
        Particular the one about the sawdust</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dust
        <li>Black Pepper
        <li>Doing the following:
            <ol>
                <li>Cutting some wood using a saw</li>
                <li>Forgetting to clean the dust off.</li>
                <li>Looking at the cut real close in order to make sure that it's right</li>
                <li>Breathing in
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's worse when I breathe in slowly and get a real lung-full of fresh sawdust</li>
                        <li>The sawdust does smell nice though</li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Next Funny Item</li>
        <li>The Final, Deeply Insighful Item</li>
    </ul>
